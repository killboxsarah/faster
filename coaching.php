        <center><h5 style="color: #808285;"> Sarah Hipel believes in an open approach to playing, leading, and learning the sport of roller derby while loving the fun of roller skating itself. After a decade in the sport she has refined her approach to an ethos of freely sharing everything she knows while trying to absorb all that she can. Sarah sees our sport as constantly evolving and derives enjoyment from playing with both game theory and skating skills. <br>
        <br>

        Sarah has continuously held a roster spot on a top 10 team and played in 13 WFTDA Big 5 tournaments, first with the Detroit Derby Girls then the Texas Rollergirls where she is currently the co-captain of the Texecutioners. She is one of the most experienced players in the game and continues to develop cross training techniques, coaching, and the skills and strategy of the sport itself. Sarah has held major roles in the WFDTA and her home leagues.  She also owns and operates Faster Skates. </br><br></h5></center>
